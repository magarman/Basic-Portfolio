/*A note on using width and max-width: assigning an element 
a width property gives it its definitive, end-all-be-all width. 
You are stating that "element X's width is Y", plain and simple. 
Assigning an element the max-width property, however, is 
stating that "element X's width CANNOT be MORE than Y, but 
CAN be LESS than Y". Thus, if you assign an element just a 
max-width property, it will simply take up as much space as 
necessary to wrap around the element(s) contained within it.*/
